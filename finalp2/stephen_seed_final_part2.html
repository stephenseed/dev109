      Final Part 2
    </h1>
    <p>
      <b>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I had no previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javasript although I had programmed
          in older languages.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <b>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch and
      why?</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I mostly built my portfolio fron scratch, but I did reuse a lot of my
          own code once I had created some. For example, this page comes from one
          of the modules I had created to show font work. I did also utilize the
          guidance in the modules and some of those came with starting points to
          utilize.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <b>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template,
      artifacts, CSS, etc.)?</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I struggled with understanding the DOM principle and took a long time
          and experimentation to get to an understanding that helped me with development.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <b>How did this class change your view on Web Development?</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I thought web development was much more complex than it turned out to
          be. While there are complications, like the relationship between CSS, Javascript
          and HTML, it is fairly straight forward.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <b>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Get a broad understanding of how the three different areas relate to each
          other early. With that, it would be easier to get to grips with each of
          the compponents used to develop a robust web site.
        </li>
      </ul>
